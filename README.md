# mumble2podcast
A relatively simple bash script for taking a mumble recording and converting it to a podcast

Requires sox and a perl script written by Dave Morris called fix_tags that can be found here 
https://github.com/davmo/fix_tags

a helpful hint to getting fix_tags working
you are going to need to download Audio::TagLib from here
http://search.cpan.org/~gleach/Audio-TagLib/
and install it manually

here is a good reference for installing perl modules
